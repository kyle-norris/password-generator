This is a small project based on a FrontendMentor.io [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/password-generator-app-Mr8CLycqjh). It generates a password for the user based on the rules selected.
The user can choose whether to include lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, and symbols. They can also choose the length of the password.
\
Once a password is generated, the [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) library is used to calculate its strength.
